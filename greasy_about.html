  About Greasy's Diner</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">
  Established in 1960, Greasy's Diner has remained a staple of traditional American fare for decades. The restaurant itself was constructed from the remains of a crashed train car, and has since been updated to meet modern dining standards. Within the redwood walls of Greasy's Diner, you can expect to find a variety of excellent dishes, and a friendly staff. We work hard to ensure that the slogan, "We Have Food" rings true throughout all of Gravity Falls.
